# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
# "THE SILVER TSUNAMI"

## OVERVIEW

In this module I explored databases using SQL. 
A company, Pewlett-Hackard, is anticipating what has been referred to as, "The Silver Tsunami", or the mass ritrement of the 
Baby-Boomer generation. Pewlett-Hackard, PH, is preparing for what the future retirements mean for the company. My role is to help create a database using sql and use said database to answer questions about PH's workforce utilizing queries. 

In this new analysis I will write queries to find the number of retiring employees by title and identify the employees eligible for the mentorship program.
### GOALS

* Design an ERD that will apply to the data.
* Create and use a SQL database.
* Import and export large CSV datasets into pgAdmin.
* Practice using different joins to create new tables in pgAdmin.
* Write basic- to intermediate-level SQL statements.


## RESULTS

### CHALLENGE 
Find the number of retiring employees by title AND Find the employees eligible for the mentorship program.
* First, I visualized and stored a table  of retiring employees by title.
* Then, I filtered the data to show only the most recent positions held by the employees.
* Next, I took a count of the number of employees retiring from each title. This table clearly communicates that titles like Senior Engineer are going to need to be heavily staffed.  
* Lastly, I created the mentorship eligibility table. This table shows employees elgible for part-time mentorship based on their age and current employment status. 

## SUMMARY

1. How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?

2. Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard   employees?
